# JPOD MANUAL

JPOD is short for '**J**ob **Po**stings **D**atabase'. It hosts job adds data the CIEB first acquired in 2022 from JobsPickr. The idea of JPOD is to have an easily updateable and manageable database that allows to add further job-ads data in the future - be it from JobsPickR or other providers.

## JPOD in Brief

For now, JPOD is set up as a SQLite Database, which is one of the most common relational database management systems (RDBMS) in the world (https://www.sqlite.org/). SQLite is especially suitable for relatively 'small' databases and is easily transferable since the entire database is stored as a single file. SQLite features a lightweight command line program called 'sqlite3', which allows one to execute SQL statements from the CL. Besides, sqlite is compatible to interact with all kinds of IDEs (e.g. DBeaver, DB Browser, Beekeper Studio) and there are several libraries to directly interact with sqlite using Python and/or R.  

JPOD as well as its source code is stored on scicore in the CIEB's GROUP folder under the directory `/scicore/home/weder/GROUP/Innovation/05_job_adds_data/`. The created sqlite database is stored in the file `jpod.db` (about 17.2 GB). The source code is available in the directory `jpod/`, which is also on GitHub (https://github.com/cieb-unibas/jpod). 

Currently (i.e. January 2023), JPOD contains 3'211'219 Swiss job postings from 76'935 different institutions.

## Setting Up JPOD from scratch: 

The initial setup is performed along the lines of the 2022 JobsPickR data. JPOD builds on 26 variables from this batch of data, which are distributed across 3 different SQL tables: `job_postings`, `position_characteristics` and `institutions`. The `job_postings` table contains all information around the postings as such (e.g., the date a posting was retrieved, the posting text, the webpage it was published on). The `position_characteristics` table features information about the job postion described by the posting (e.g., the location of the position, the employers' name etc.). Finally, the table `institutions` contains information about all employers that have postings in the database (e.g., the employer's webpage, the employer's phone number etc.). This database schema, JPODs initial architecture, is defined in the file `scicore/create_jpod.sqlite`. 

### Inserting raw data to JPOD (2022 JobsPickR Data)

JPOD is set up on scicore using the slurm scirpt `scripts/scicore/jpod_launch.sh`. This scirpt implements the initial architecture of JPOD and then inserts the 2022 raw data from JobsPickr (this data can be found as zipped `.csv` files in the directory `/scicore/home/weder/GROUP/Innovation/05_job_adds_data/jobspickr_raw/`). 

Since the latter is performed using a Python script, we first need to install a Python virtual environment. Such a virtual environment can be setup via the bash script `scicore/create_venv.sh`. 
**However**, *this step is not necessary since a virtaul environment has already been created on scicore. For setting up correpsonding virtual environment on your local machine, see the documentation of either [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments) or [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html)*.

Assuming you are in the `jpod/` root directory, the file `scripts/scicore/jpod_launch.sh` can then be sent to the cluster for setting up JPOD from scratch using the command `sbatch scripts/scicore/launch_jpod.sh`. Executing this file creates the JPOD database (using the `scripts/create_jpod.sqlite` script) and then calls the python script `scripts/insert_base.py`. The latter loads the 2022 JobsPickr raw data, performs several cleaning steps to it (e.g. lowercase selected columns, distinct rows only etc.) and then inserts the cleaned raw data to the above-mentioned 3 tables of JPOD.

## JPOD Architecture: Tables and Keys

Since JPOD's initial architecture is very closely related to JobsPickR, its original setup depends on JobsPickR information. Most importantly, this concerns the column `uniq_id`, which is taken as is from the JobsPickR raw data. `uniq_id` is a identifier variable oft type `str` and length 32, consisting entirely of ASCII characters and digits. In JPOD, this column serves as a SQL primary key in the two tables `job_postings` and `position_characteristics`. These two tables can thus be connected (i.e. joined) through the column `uniq_id`. Note: For potential future updates with data acquired from other providers than Jobspickr, it might therefore be necessary to create corresponding `uniq_id`'s from scratch. The third initial table is the `institutions` table, where information about companies can be accessed. The `institutions` table is connected to the other tables through the column `company_name`, which is also featured in the `position_characteristics` table. A graphical overview of the base JPOD architecture and how different tables can be joined is presented below.

## Enhancing JPOD

### Assigning Postings to NUTS-Regions and OECD Territorial Levels

A key feature of JPOD is to enable analyses on the regional level. To be compatible with commonly used regional taxonomies, job postings are assigned to Eurostat's [NUTS regions](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background/), as well as the [OECD territorial Grid Taxonomy](https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-statistics/territorial-grid.pdf). To do this, the `/jpod/add_geogrid.py` script first reads data from the (manually created) file `data/regio_grid.csv` and creates an additional JPOD overview table `regio_grid`. This table consits of columns indicating a geographical entity's name in English, German and French, its abbrevation (if it exists) and all it's NUTS and OECD TL codes (if they exist). An example of rows from this table is given below:

name_en|name_de|name_fr|regio_abbrev|nuts_level|oecd_level|iso_2|iso_3|nuts_0|nuts_1|nuts_2|nuts_3|oecd_tl1|oecd_tl2|oecd_tl3|self_classified
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
switzerland|schweiz|suisse|CH|1|1|CH|CHE|CH|CH0|||CH|||no
espace mittelland|espace mittelland|espace mittelland||2|2|CH|CHE|CH|CH0|CH02||CH|CH02||no
California|||||2|US|USA|||||US|US06||no
Bavaria|Bayern|||1|2|DE|DEU|DE|DE2|||DE|DE2||no
basel-stadt|basel-stadt|b√¢le-ville|BS|3|3|CH|CHE|CH|CH0|CH03|CH031|CH|CH03|CH031|no

The actual assignment of job postings to the stated regions in the `regio_grid` table was initially performed via the script `scripts/assign_geo.py` for Swiss job postings. Using slurm, this script can also be sent to the cluster via the `scicore/jpod_augment.sh` script. Job postings are thereby assigned a territorial code based on the columns `city`, `inferred_city`, `state`, and `inferred_state` in the `position_characteristics` table. More specifically, the script first creates two new columns, `nuts_2` and `nuts_3`, in the `position_characteristics` table (indicating the location of every job posting) and fills them with NUTS codes if values in the columns `city`, `inferred_city`, `state`, and/or `inferred_state` can be (exactly) matched to one of the values in the columns `name_en`, `name_de`, `name_fr` and/or `regio_abbrev` in the `regio_grid` table. After acquiring further data with international coverage in 2023, regional assignment for job postings was directly taken care of in the database [updating process](#updating-jpod-inserting-new-job-adds).

Hence, **geographical information for NUTS-levels 2 and 3 are directly observed in the `position_characteristics` table**. If other terrtorial information has to be retrieved (e.g. another aggregation level or the English, French or German name of the NUTS code), this can be retrieved by joining the `position_characteristics` with the `regio_grid` table. A graphical overview is given in Figure 2.

**Figure 2: ER Diagram of JPOD's regional information**

**Notes on Refined Matching**: Some job postings state their geographical information in a special way (e.g. 'baselstadt' instead of 'basel-stadt' or 'bs'). To capture these false negatives to some extent, refined matching operations were additionally performed for the largest non-matched Swiss entities via the `scripts/assign_geo.py` script. After all of these operations 92.6\% of the 3'211'219 job postings in the initial JPOD could be matched to NUTS 2 regions.

### Duplicate Cleaning

JPOD features job postings that have distinct identifiers from Jobspickr. That means, *exact duplicates* should have been removed already before insertion to JPOD. However, there is still a substantial fraction of postings that has exactly duplicated counterparts. 

There are several possible reason for this. First, it is possible that Jobspickr's duplicate cleaning process failed to clean the duplicates. Second, it is possible that an employer published the same posting at different times (e.g., a restaurant searches for a waiter in the beginning and the end of the year), implying that it should not be treated as a duplicate. Finally, it can also be that an employer publishes the same posting at different locations (e.g., a restaurant chain searches for waiters at different locations), again suggesting that such postings should not be treated as duplicates.

JPOD takes these issues into account. The columns `unique_posting_text` and `unique_posting_textlocation` in the `job_postings` table provide the respective information. Both columns take on the value `no` if a certain posting has a counterpart with an exactly identical `job_description`. The difference between the two columns `unique_posting_text` and `unique_posting_textlocation` is that the former searches for exact duplicates in the overall database, and the latter only checks for duplicates in the same `city`. 

Hence, JPOD can be easily subsetted to unique job postings using the values of these two columns in a `WHERE` statement. For example, the following statement will extract all non-duplicated postings' uniq_id, the corresponding employer, the city and the job_description.

```sql
SELECT jp.uniq_id, pc.compay_name, pc.city, jp.job_description
FROM job_postings jp
WHERE jp.unique_posting_text == 'yes'
LEFT JOIN position_characteristics pc on jp.uniq_id = pc.uniq_id;
```

**Notes on Duplicates**: Duplicated postings are substantial in JPOD. In fact, 1'446'838 of the 3‚Äô211‚Äô219 Swiss postings in the database have at least one exact duplicate in the overall database (i.e. 45%). Think carefully what kind of data your analyses requires and set the `unique_posting_text` filters in your queries accordingly. Jobspickr improved their cleaning subsequently and these rates are normally lower in the 2023 batch of postings. There, the share of duplicates varies by country as you can see in the subsequent table:

country|number of postings in 2023 batch|number of unique postings|share of unique postings
---|---|---|---
|60||
austria|73912|42736|0.578

### Identifiying Postings with a Connection to AI or Disruptive Technologies

At the time of developing JPOD, the CIEB has been particularly interested in examining technological trends. To this end, JPOD features to additional tables that list postings with a connection to Artificial Intelligence or certain Disruptive Technologies. Postings' `uniq_id`'s are registered in these tables if their full text contains certain keywords that are related to a technology. The corresponding keyword-query-functions are defined in the [jpod.datagen](../jpod/datagen.py) module. For AI, the keywords are taken from <a href='https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/718327'>Acemoglu et al. (2022) (Footnote 13)</a>, and for disruptive technologies from <a href='https://www.nber.org/papers/w28999'>Bloom et al. (2020)</a>.

The two tables in question are accordingly named `acemoglu_ai` and `bloom_tech`. Note that they only feature a minimum amount of information, which can be used to subset postings from other tables. For example, the following query would return the number of AI-related postings in Swiss regions:

```sql
SELECT pc.nuts_2 AS region, COUNT(aa.uniq_id) AS n_ai_postings
FROM acemoglu_ai aa
LEFT JOIN position_characteristics pc ON aa.uniq_id = pc.uniq_id
WHERE pc.inferred_country = 'switzerland'
GROUP BY region
HAVING region IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY n_ai_postings DESC
```

## Updating JPOD: Inserting New Job Postings

A core feature of JPOD is to make it easy to add more data to it. The majority of the source code contained in this repository serves to facilitate this process. It has been applied and tested in 2023 to add additional data from Jobspickr. 

The following presents a step-by-step overview of how to update JPOD with new data, using the case of the data purchase in 2023 from Jobspickr.

:warning: **IMPORTANT:** This walk-through may need adaption if the raw data comes from a different source or changed its format. 

#### Step 1: Configure JPOD
The first and most important step is that you adapt the [config.py](../jpod/config.py) module's parameter `BATCH_VERSION`, which is currently set to `jobspickr_2023_01`. **The naming schema follows the rule `DATASOURCE_YEAR_VERSION`, which is very important.** For example for a new data purchase in 2024 at Jobspickr, set the `BATCH_VERSION` parameter in [config.py](../jpod/config.py) to `jobspickr_2024_01`. 

#### Step 1: Gather the data
Jobspickr provides raw data in zipped files through google docs. These can either be downloaded manually or using a script. **The important part is that they are stored correctly.** To do this, create a new folder in the directory `/scicore/home/weder/GROUP/Innovation/05_job_adds_data/jobspickr_raw/`, which you name identically to the `BATCH_VERSION` in [config.py](../jpod/config.py). Once this folder is created, all the zipped files delivered by jobspickr can be stored in it. This can either be done manually or using a scirpt such as [`download_postings.py`](../scripts/download_postings.py) (after creating a config file in the newly created folder.) 

#### Step 3: Adapt the regional information in JPOD if necessary
In the updating process, postings in JPOD are assigned to regions as explained [above](#assigning-postings-to-nuts-regions-and-oecd-territorial-levels). All regions that should be considered for that purpose are registered in the [regio_grid.csv](../data/regio_grid.csv) file. **This file has to be adapted manually if additional regions that are not yet registered should be taken into account.** The file structure (i.e. the columns) must be preserved! During the updating process, JPOD matches `inferred_state` names in the Jobspickr raw data against the specified `name_en` values in the `regio_grid.csv` file.

#### Step 4: Insert the raw data into JPOD
To do this, run the slurm script [jpod_update.sh](../scripts/scicore/jpod_update.sh). This script will check (1) if the raw data has entries with duplicated identifier variables (which would cause SQL errors), (2) checks whether data from some files has already been inserted to JPOD (in case you run the updating process in several steps), (3) updates the regional information in JPOD according to your specifications described [above](#step-3-adapt-the-regional-information-in-jpod-if-necessary), (4) inserts all the raw data and some additionally created information (e.g., the data batch, regional information) to JPOD.

#### Step 5: Enhance JPOD: Duplicated Postings and Identification of AI & Disruptive Technology Postings
The final step is to enhance the information contained in JPOD. This can be done through the [jpod_augment.sh](../scripts/scicore/jpod_augment.sh) script, which runs the following three scripts: [clean_duplicates.py](../scripts/clean_duplicates.py), [detect_disruptech.py](../scripts/detect_disruptech.py) and [detect_ai.py](../scripts/detect_ai.py). 

While the latter two are easily handled by scicore and do not require any changes, the `clean_duplicates.py`'s runtimes can be a challenge. **It is thus recommended to run `clean_duplicates.py` seperately for selected countries that dont have more than 3 million postings.**. This behavior can be controlled by specifying the paramater `RESTRICT_TO_GEO_UNITS` in [clean_duplicates.py](../scripts/clean_duplicates.py). For example, to only clean duplicates in JPOD for Germany and Italy, change as follows in the script `RESTRICT_TO_GEO_UNITS = ["germany", "italy"]`.

After completing these steps, JPOD should be successfully updated with the new data.

**:bangbang: Note** if something goes wrong, there is the [clean_tables.py](../scripts/clean_tables.py) script which you can use to delete all data from JPOD for a given batch of data. You have to specify the data bacth using the `DELETE_BATCH` parameter in this script. For example, specify `DELETE_BATCH = "jobspickr_2023_01"` to delete all data from the 2023 jobspickr batch. **HOWEVER, BE VERY CAREFULL WITH THIS SCRIPT**.

## Final Remarks

There are some particular issues where JPOD is likely to have much room for improvement (see the GitHub issues in this repository).

- **Updating performance**: The script [jpod_update.py](../scripts/jpod_update.py) inserts data from its raw form into the three JPOD tables `job_postings`, `position_characteristics` and `institutions`. The institutions table only contains unique employers, but to determine that, the script currently has to check for every new employer in the raw data, if it already exists in JPOD. This is very inefficient. A more elegent solution could be to not insert raw data into the `institutions` table at all in a first round. After the other two tables are filled, a list of unique employer names could be extracted from the database and then applied to the raw data to select employers who should be inserted.

- **Query Performance**: Growing in size, JPOD has become much slower for performing queries. The use of SQL indexes improves this problem somewhat, but there might be further improvements possible, by deleting unnecessary columns in several tables. Unnecessary means here columns that are never used for any analysis. Certain candidates could e.g., be the html_job_description column in den job_postings table, the inferred_departement in the position_characteristics table or almost everything in the institutions table.

- **Data Provider**: If the CIEB would get further job postings data not from Jobspickr anymore, then one would have to create `uniq_id` values for such new postings. This should not be a problem as such, but should not get forgotten.
