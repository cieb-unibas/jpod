# JPOD Query examples
Here you can find some code examples in `python` and `R` that indicate how to query the database.

```
examples
├── jpod_ex.py
├── jpod_ex.R
├── pharma_ai/
    ├── pharma_firm_list.csv
    ├── pharma_ai.R
    ├── pharma_ai_scicore.sh
```

`jpod_ex.py` and `jpod_ex.R` both shwo you basic functionality to query the database. 

A somewhat more detailed example is a small project to extract job postings related to AI from a list of pharmaceutical companies. This example also includes how to query the full database `jpod.db` through the cluster and using slurm.
