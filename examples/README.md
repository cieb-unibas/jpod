# JPOD Query examples
Here you can find some code examples in `python` and `R` that indicate how to query the database.

`jpod_ex.py` and `jpod_ex.R` are scripts that show you basic functionality to query the JPOD database. It focuses on retrieving simple datasets, joining tables and keyword searches.

A somewhat more detailed example is a small project to extract job postings related to AI from a list of pharmaceutical companies. This example also includes how to query the full database `jpod.db` through the cluster and using slurm. More information can be found in the directory ["pharma_ai/"](./pharma_ai/)
